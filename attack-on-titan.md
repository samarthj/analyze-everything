## Attack on Titan

If you don't care about the media format and just want to consume a fictional universe, I can't recommend Attack on Titan enough. It is the most intense piece of media out there. Trigger warning for violence and gore, with an insane amount of gut-wrenching, heartbreaking, soul crushing moments you have ever seen. Considering that every little triumph that you do get will feel like scaling giant hill, with you jumping out of your seat and shouting at the top of your lungs.
